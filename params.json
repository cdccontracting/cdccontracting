Not really a big problem for shoveling snow from a roof. It usually takes half an hour to an hour to remove the snow and most roofing contractors even charge you extra for this, as long as they are there to replace the roof and not only snow removal (a service that many companies offer ceiling in the northeast).\r\n\r\nIs it necessary for the crew to be careful when doing this to avoid falling? Of course. However, the team has to be careful in all aspects when it comes to roofing a house, this is nothing new. These guys are professionals and safety should always come first and always comes first with a roofing company responsible.\r\n\r\nTo get more information about [roofer long beach](http://www.cdccontracting.net/gaf-roofing-long-beach-ny-11561.php) or simple visit our Place :- 9 Loring Rd,Levittown, ny, 11756\r\n\r\nFollow us on: [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/cdccontractingnet/570515019645867)and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cdccontractingn)\r\n\r\nRead MY Blogs on: [Blogger](http://cdccontracting.blogspot.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
